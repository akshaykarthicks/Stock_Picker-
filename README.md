# StockPicker Crew

An intelligent multi-agent AI system for stock analysis and investment recommendations, powered by [crewAI](https://crewai.com). This project uses collaborative AI agents to analyze trending companies, conduct financial research, and provide investment recommendations based on the latest market news and data.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Analysis**: Three specialized AI agents work together to provide comprehensive stock analysis
- **Real-Time News Monitoring**: Automatically finds trending companies based on latest financial news
- **Comprehensive Research**: Conducts detailed financial analysis of identified companies
- **Investment Recommendations**: Provides data-driven stock picking decisions with detailed rationale
- **Automated Reporting**: Generates structured reports in JSON and Markdown formats

## Curated Showcase (CrewAI Multi‑Agent Patterns)

Curated list of how this project demonstrates intelligent agents collaborating to automate complex workflows.

- **Multi-agent collaboration**
  - **Role-specialized agents**: `📰 Financial News Analyst`, `🔍 Senior Financial Researcher`, `📊 Stock Picker` coordinate via tasks pipeline defined in `src/stock_picker/config/tasks.yaml` and `src/stock_picker/crew.py`.
  - **Tool-driven capabilities**: Extendable via `src/stock_picker/tools/` for web search, parsing, and financial data enrichment.
  - **Handoff patterns**: Outputs from one agent (trending companies) become inputs for the next (deep research) and culminate in a final decision.

- **Finance and research examples**
  - **Trending discovery**: News scanning to surface 2–3 companies per sector → saves to `output/trending_companies.json`.
  - **Company deep-dive**: Fundamentals and sentiment synthesis → `output/research_report.json` with market position, growth, and potential.
  - **Investment decision**: Clear recommendation and rationale → `output/decision.md` ready for PM/analyst review.
  - **Sectors included**: AI/ML, Healthcare Tech, Renewables, Fintech, E‑commerce, Cybersecurity, EVs, Biotech, Semiconductors, Cloud.

- **Production-ready patterns**
  - **Config-as-data**: Agents and tasks in YAML (`src/stock_picker/config/agents.yaml`, `src/stock_picker/config/tasks.yaml`) enable safe iteration and quick A/B.
  - **Deterministic interfaces**: Each stage writes typed artifacts to `output/` enabling retries and offline inspection.
  - **Streamlit UI for operators**: `src/stock_picker/ui/app.py` runs end‑to‑end flows, visualizes progress, and exposes downloads.
  - **Environment handling**: `.env` via `python-dotenv` locally, Streamlit Secrets in the cloud; SQLite shim for portability.
  - **Composable entrypoints**: CLI in `src/stock_picker/main.py` and UI launchers in `pyproject.toml` scripts.

Use this section as a template to compare with other CrewAI systems and to extend this project with additional agents (e.g., risk modeling, valuation, portfolio construction) following the same handoff and artifact patterns.

### Agent Workflow

The StockPicker Crew consists of three specialized agents working in sequence:

1. **📰 Financial News Analyst** - Scans latest news to identify 2-3 trending companies in a specified sector
2. **🔍 Senior Financial Researcher** - Conducts comprehensive analysis of the trending companies  
3. **📊 Stock Picker** - Analyzes research findings and selects the best investment opportunity

```

## Installation

Ensure you have Python >=3.10 <3.14 installed on your system. This project uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management.

1. **Install UV** (if not already installed):
```bash
pip install uv
```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
```bash
crewai install
```

3. **Configure API Keys** - You have several options:

**Option 1: Local Development (.env file)**
Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API keys:
```bash
# Copy .env.example to .env and fill in your keys
cp .env.example .env
# Then edit .env with your actual keys
```

**Option 2: Environment Variables**
Set the following environment variables in your system:
```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_api_key_here
```

**Option 3: Streamlit Cloud Secrets**
If deploying to Streamlit Cloud, set your keys in Settings → Secrets:
```
GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key"
SERPER_API_KEY="your_serper_key"
```

The application will check for keys in this order:
1. Streamlit Cloud secrets (if deployed)
2. Environment variables
3. .env file (for local development)

## Configuration

- **Agents**: Modify `src/stock_picker/config/agents.yaml` to customize agent roles and capabilities
- **Tasks**: Modify `src/stock_picker/config/tasks.yaml` to define analysis workflows
- **Sector Focus**: Change the target sector in `src/stock_picker/main.py` (default: "AI and Machine Learning")
- **Custom Tools**: Add specialized tools in `src/stock_picker/tools/`

## Running the Project

To start the stock analysis process, run from the root folder:

```bash
crewai run
```

Or run directly with Python:
```bash
python -m stock_picker.main
```

## Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. In Streamlit Cloud, create a new app pointing to `src/stock_picker/ui/app.py` as the entry file.
3. Set Secrets under Settings → Secrets with:
```
GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key"
SERPER_API_KEY="your_serper_key"
```
4. Deploy. The system reads secrets first, then falls back to environment variables.

The system will:
1. Search for trending companies in the AI and Machine Learning sector
2. Conduct detailed financial research on identified companies
3. Select the best investment opportunity
4. Generate comprehensive reports in the `output/` directory

## Output Files

The analysis generates several output files:

- `output/trending_companies.json` - List of trending companies found in the news
- `output/research_report.json` - Detailed financial analysis of each company
- `output/decision.md` - Final investment recommendation with rationale

## Customization

### Changing the Target Sector
Edit `src/stock_picker/main.py` to analyze different sectors:
```python
inputs = {
    'sector': 'Healthcare Technology'  # Change this to your preferred sector
}
```

### Adding Custom Tools
Create new tools in `src/stock_picker/tools/` to extend agent capabilities:
- Financial data APIs
- Technical analysis tools
- Risk assessment modules
- Portfolio optimization tools

### Agent Configuration
Each agent can be customized in `src/stock_picker/config/agents.yaml`:
- Change LLM models (currently using Gemini 1.5 Flash)
- Modify agent roles and goals
- Add specialized tools and capabilities

## Available Commands

- `crewai run` - Execute the full stock analysis workflow

## Requirements

- Python >=3.10, <3.14
- UV package manager
- Gemini API key (for LLM functionality)
- Internet connection (for news and financial data)

## Troubleshooting

**API Key Issues**: Ensure your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is properly set in the `.env` file
**Streamlit Cloud**: Prefer setting keys in Secrets. The UI shows key presence in the sidebar.
**API Cost Is More** :Ensure the cost
